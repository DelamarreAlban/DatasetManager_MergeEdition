1 - Put every file in a accurately named folder
2 - Once selected the app will prepare the export and show it when it is done. (Check number of file and number of lines)
3 - File will be export in the same folder

Issues:
 - Make sure that the folder "readonly" option is not checked.


Explanation:
 - The app take the first word of the first line as the state.
 - The name of the folder became the attribute. (WORKS ONLY ONE ATTRIBUTE BY ONE ATTRIBUTE)
 - Reading the file, the app will detect the "Date" to know that the data are coming the line after.
	First item is splited in two for "Year" and "Month" attribute. The second attribute is the value. Third value is ignored
